        <p>
           <p>I'm an Android Developer based in Toronto, Canada who specializes in Mobile Application Development and Electronics Engineering. I grew up in a small town in Ambala (India). Since my childhood I had keen interest in Engineering and Technology. I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who opened my eyes to the world of design and technology, this altered the path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After finishing my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the University of Kurukshetra, I moved to Chandigarh, India, in hope of becoming a professional electronics designer. My good technical knowledge and communication skills enabled me to get placed in one of the most renowned organization in the area i.e. MHL ENGINEERING PVT. LTD. I worked on several projects, one of which was project “Thyristor Working” which we designed for the famous automobile company Hero MotoCorp Ltd. The purpose of this equipment was to teach the bike mechanics about the working principle of “Thyristor” which they were going to use in the new upcoming bike models. </p>
            <br>
           <p>Because of my hunger to learn new things and explore new technologies, I decided to study further to enhance my knowledge and skills especially in rapidly growing field of Mobile Application Development. In September,2019, I moved to Canada for a Post Graduation Diploma in Mobile Applications Development at Cambrian College at Hanson. I've finished my two semesters and learned the basics of the application development especially for Android phones. </p>
            <br>
           <p> Now I’m looking for a 13 to 26 weeks co-op placement as a Junior Android Developer in your company. I strongly believe in working with other people towards a common goal and I know the skills I bring not only as an engineer, but as a team member will not only bring me work satisfaction, but will make me a valuable teammate as well. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I love outdoor sports especially cricket. I like comedy shows, action movies and listening to music in my leisure time. I am highly obsessed about photography and I never miss a chance to click pictures. </p>
