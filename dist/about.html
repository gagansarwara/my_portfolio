        <p>I'm an Electronics Engineer based in Toronto, Canada who specializes in Mobile Application Development and Electronics Engineering; I also have photography obsession.

            I grew up in Ambala, India: a small town. Here I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who opened my eyes to the world of design and technology; this would alter the path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine.
            
            After finishing my Bachelor's at the University of Kurukshetra, I moved to Chandigarh, India, in hopes of becoming a professional electronics designer.My good technical knowledge and communication skills enabled me to get placed in one of the most renowned organization in the area i.e. MHL ENGINEERING PVT. LTD. I worked on several projects, one of which was project “ Thyristor Working ” which we designed for the famous automobile company Hero Motocorp. Ltd. The purpose of this equipment was to teach the bike mechanics about the working principle of “Thyristor” which they were going to use in the new upcoming bike models. I also contributed socially by teaching my neighboring students, especially the under privileged over the past 2 years. This experience is very precious and inestimable to me as it provided me with an opportunity to share my knowledge I gained over the past years.
            
            Because of my hunger to learn new things and explore new technologies, I decided to study further to enhance my knowledge and skills especially in rapidly growing field of Mobile Application Development therefore in 2019, I moved to canada.
            
            I love outdoor sports especially cricket.I like comedy shows , action movies and listening to music in my leisure time.I am highly obsessed about photography and i never miss a chance to click pictures. </p>
